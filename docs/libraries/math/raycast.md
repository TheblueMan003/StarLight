## ` lazy void shoot(float distance, float precision, bool stopCondtion, bool=>void action)`
Raycast with a `distance` and with step `precision`. Stop When `stopCondtion` is true or distance is reach.Call `action` at the end with `true` if stopCondtion was `true` and false otherwise.

## ` lazy void laser(float distance, float precision, bool stopCondtion, float=>void step, bool=>void action)`
Raycast with a `distance` and with step `precision`. Stop When `stopCondtion` is true or distance is reach.Call `step` at every step with argument corresponding to the distance remaining.Call `action` at the end with `true` if stopCondtion was `true` and false otherwise.
